        le bon jean, French meaning "the good denim." The story of workwear and American militaria has an impressive cast of characters, but denim has always stolen the show. The story of workwear is, at its core, the story of denim. It is a story written in indigo ink on a surface of woven cotton, which continues to captivate many. Wool, leather, canvas, and duck cloth all play important roles, but it's denim that looms large in the history of workwear. More than any other fabric, it bears the imprint of both workers and servicemen and the work they do. It has a story of its own, but also tells a story about us.

      <h3>[History]</h3>
      <p>
        From the 1850s onward a blue tide spread across America as workers, more particularly Californian gold diggers, began to adopt blue denim. At the start of what could possibly be called the "golden age of workwear" all necessary ingredients were combined to develop a garment that was far superior than anything else available at the time. Both cotton and indigo were available in the American South, world-class textile mills in the Northeast, and, most importantly, laborers in the West that needed a solution to the pockets on their working trousers being constantly torn off. This solution was found by a Latvian tailor working in Reno, Nevada when he was able to not only bring all of these ingredients together, but bind them to each other. How did he do this? With a rivet. Jacob Davis had sold around 200 pairs of his riveted waist overalls (what we know today as jeans, though that nickname wasn’t given until the 1960s) when he reached out to San Francisco dry goods merchant Levi Strauss in 1872. Strauss could see that reinforced overalls presented a huge market opportunity. With Davis overseeing production, the wholesaler changed to a manufacturing model. These overalls featured a button fly with recessed button centers, a single back pocket, suspender buttons, and a cinch back. Until the patent ran out in the early 1890's, Levi's riveted waist overalls towered over any competition. By the time competing brands were able to introduce their own versions of riveted overalls, Levi Strauss had managed to perfect the manufacturing process and build a nearly unshakable reputation as the king of workwear, trailblazing a flourishing denim industry. Customers would often buy two pairs at a time - one for work and another for trips to town. The "go-to-town" pair would be kept relatively clean, while the work pair would be worn until they were no longer usable and be discarded in mine shafts or logging camps (where vintage dealers and denim collectors are still digging up long forgotten pairs today). It was even reported that at times customers would simply dispose of their worn jeans on the floor of the dry goods store, walking out the door wearing their new pair. It was, however, seldom that workers were able to make trips to a dry goods store, and orders were often sent by mail through a catalog and delivered to work sites. The process of sanforization (a treatment process in which fabric is subject to extremely high heat in order to reduce the shrinkage which would otherwise occur after washing) had yet to be invented, and it was too costly to manufacture jeans in as many different sizes as we had today. This meant that customers would have to shrink their own jeans down to the desired size (which came to be known as shrink-to-fit). Often this was done through boiling the jeans, or sitting in a creek while wearing them. For workers, the denim jean was a disposable yet indispensable tool. Naturally, in 1901 the US Navy began ordering their clothes from workwear manufacturing companies, and adopted the “Bell Bottom” denim trouser for some of its troops. This was a shape that has been used since 1817 among the Marine forces, as it was easier to roll up in order to avoid getting wet. In the early days of this adoption only engineering crews, Gunnery crews, submarine crews, coaling crews, and other uniform soiling activity crews could wear the denim utility uniform. Administrative roles were not only not issued the uniform, but forbidden to have one aboard ship. In addition to being a durable working fabric, the blue denim also served as a type of camouflage while out at sea. After the trousers, a pullover shirt without buttons appeared in the Navy. Following the Navy in 1908, the US Coast Artillery Corps adopted its first blue denim uniform. This was composed of a pullover shirt with three flap-pockets and trousers with patch style pockets. The rest of the US Army received twill fabric, canvas, and brown denim. Shortly before World War I, in September 1910, the Quartermaster Department revised the fatigue clothing for all enlisted men and imposed that all US Army units wear the blue fatigue uniform of the Coast Artillery Corps. 
Also near the beginning of the twentieth century, workwear had started to fuse with the popular image of the American cowboy. Some of the first actors to wear denim on camera were extras in westerns that would show up to the set in their work clothes. Not long after denim and workwear was brought into the spotlight, weaving together rugged clothing and the pioneering spirit of the Old West. This connection was made more apparent during the Great Depression, when Farm Security Administration photographer Dorothea Lange began documenting the lives of impoverished working class Americans. Some of America’s most striking images were created showing their calloused hands and dusty clothes. The hard worn workwear told a story of its own - of long and fruitless toil. Yet, in the photographs Americans could see their own tenacious spirit. World War II put the nation back to work, and after the war workwear started to become streetwear. Denim had become synonymous with America itself and had been woven into nearly every facet of American life, from mainstream culture to counterculture.

        The denim jean has been around for nearly 150 years, and has gone through quite the evolution since its inception in 1873. The jean has gone through many makeovers in its already long life, and is now nearly a different piece of garment entirely from the nineteenth-century waist overall design from Jacob Davis and Levi Strauss. This, hardly exhaustive, list will attempt to take you on a walk down memory lane of the history of the denim jean from the three largest denim manufacturers: Levi's, Wrangler, and Lee. From inception through every major variation, all the way to current forms today, highlighting every major difference along the way that will help denim collectors and enthusiasts in accurately dating their American classics.Starting with the Levi's, it all began with The Two Horse brand patch. At least, for the sake of dating a pair of jeans. The Two Horse brand patch was implemented in 1886, sixteen years after Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis patented the copper-riveted waist overall. A pair of Levi's with the Two Horse brand patch still intact is, realistically, near impossible to come by. And if you're lucky enough to find a pair, they'll be far out of reach for the average person. Recently a 1902 pair of 501s in good vintage condition sold for around $35,000 USD. However, using The Two Horse brand patch to date denim will seldom be relevant as most vintage jeans are worn and washed countless times which generally results in the patch coming off or becoming entirely undecipherable. Until 1902 Levi's jeans had only one back pocket, that year introduced two square shaped back pockets. The next"big" change came in 1922 when belt loops were added, however the cinch back still remained. 1936 introduced the iconic and identifiable red tab and removed the suspender buttons. The cinch was removed in 1942 as well as the rivets on the crotch, with a watch pocket being added. Due to the wartime need to converse resources the arcuate on the back pockets was painted rather than stitched. The stitched arcuate returned post-WWII in 1947. This remained the blueprint for Levi's jeans until 1955 when the leather patch was replaced with a Jacron “leather-like” patch, and was altered again in1962 when the  “Every Garment Guaranteed”-slogan was removed from the patch. One of the biggest changes came in 1971 when the 'e' on the red tab was changed from a big E, to a small e.
