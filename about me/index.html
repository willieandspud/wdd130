    <h2>Ryan Lloyd</h2>

    <p>I grew I grew up between Southern Idaho and Southern Washington. 
        I've lived in Rexburg for the last few years attending school part time and working.</p>
    <p>   I was previously an art major but recently switched to web design (mostly in order to graduate sooner) 
        and currently work as a photographer/videographer/graphic designer for a few different companies in Eastern Idaho. </p> 
    <p>    I spend a lot of time of time outdoors (when I'm not working or doing homework lol) and really enjoy endurance sports. </p>
    <p>   Running, climbing, hiking, etc. I'm about to start training for my next marathon, which is sometime at the end of spring, 
        and hoping to summit the Grand for the first time this summer as well. </p>
    <p>    I really admire vintage/antique things and have a hobby collecting and trading vintage denim (mostly from the 1930s-1980s) 
        and know way more about jeans than anyone probably should. </p>
    <p>    I daily drive a 1989 Jeep Grand Wagoneer 
        and have a goal to go on a road trip in it from my home in Eastern Idaho to Prudhoe Bay, AK 
        (the northern most driveable point in North America) hopefully sometime within the next year and a half.</p>
